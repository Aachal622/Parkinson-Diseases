# Parkinson-Diseases
In this implementation using python and machine learning , using the scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, we will build a model using an XGBClassifier. Load the data, get the features and labels, scale the features, then split the dataset, build an XGBClassifier, and then calculate the accuracy of our model.  Using an XGBClassifier gives us an accuracy of 94.87%.
